> Webpage designed and built from scratch, to showcase my projects as Web Developer

> Bootstrapped with Create React App, built with React.js and Tailwind CSS

### ✨ Deployed version [https://www.silviapiovesan.com/](https://www.silviapiovesan.com/)

## 🗺️ Application info

This app was built with React.js. The reason behind this choice is very simple: I wanted to try how the pair React-Tailwind CSS worked, and I wanted to build my webpage, so I took the chance. Moreover, my plan for the future is adding a blog section, so I figured I'd better start already with React.

The only libraries I used are: lodash and react-responsive as helpers, react-burger-menu and headlessUI only for the burger menu and the dialog (I recommend both for their lightweight and use simplicity), emailJS and react-google-recaptcha for email serverless sending, and react-icons.

I built the form validation totally from scratch, and also challenged myself with applying an hiding/showing effect to the navbar on top which works also on Safari.

I plan to add some features, see [my to-do list](#📔-my-to-do-list) below.

I worked hard to make this website fully accessible (if you know me, you'll know also I consider that very important). I hope I have reached the goal; if you have some feedback on that, I'd be delighted to receive it!

## 👩‍💻 Developer's info

For the time being, the website is personal so I guess there's no point in cloning/forking it.

My plan is to clean up the code a little bit and leave this as an open source template for fellow developers that want to use it or just be inspired.

Let me know if you might be interested, I'll take that into account!

🔥 Pro tip: did you check the console on loading? That's the real nerd touch :)

### 📔 My to-do list

- I want to remove all the copy (text) from the code and create literals, so that I can try i18n to add more languages (I am Italian, and I live in Spain, so that would make sense!)
- I'm pretty sure I could create more custom hooks, and have a general Dialog component loading either the JuniorDev Dialog or the ContactForm
- I'd like to add a dark theme, but still haven't explored that with tailwind css
- I want to turn this into an open source template, I think it can be helpful to other devs

If you find any bugs/improvements, please please please let me know!
