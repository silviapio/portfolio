export const about = `I'm an Economist by university, and Front End Developer by passion.
I recently graduated from IT Academy, a popular bootcamp in Barcelona, where I dived deep into JavaScript and React.js, and discovered the beauty of coding and programming. I must say, the journey has been lovely so far!
I participated in IT Academy's "real-world" team project, and I'm currently building a few React web applications. -Check my projects-
One amazing thing about programming for me is, that even when you think you reached a good understanding and you can actually build some nice things, there is still so much left to learn. I totally love that.
Before programming, I have also worked for several years in international teams in the pharmaceutical industry, getting to manage also small projects. I cherish this past work experience as it taught me a lot about how to effectively cooperate and communicate to reach results, and in general about how a company works. But my passion for problem solving and my interest in tech have driven me to learn web development and change my career. 
And, I must say, it was a good call, I'm learning lots and having a lot of fun!`;
